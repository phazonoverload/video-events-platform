# To do

- [x] Break up token generation into three separate functions, with a parent that picks which child functions gets called based on a parameter
- [x] Clean up enterStage() method to remove duplication
- [x] Clean up front-end logic as it's getting a bit complex
- [x] On stage - make it clear if the user is a speaker or audience
- [x] Make sure we remove subscribers when they no longer exist
- [ ] Allow for screensharing (ie. multiple publishers per users)
- [ ] Chat
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Better requests for usernames/access codes - we shouldn't have to provide it every time
- [ ] Error handling

Stretch goal:
